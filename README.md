# 24K Magic

This is a site to dispay coding for my prototype, this listing is from live rez.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, tells users about the site

← `index.html`: This is the main web page. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files. Try clicking the image in the center of the page!

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

← `script.js`: The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads, and when the visitor clicks the button you can add below.
